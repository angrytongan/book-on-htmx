# TODO: Mobile-Responsive Navigation

## Goal
Update the navigation in `templates/layout.tmpl` to show only icons on mobile (below `md` breakpoint) and show both icons and labels on `md` screens and above.

## Tasks
- [x] Update navigation template structure in `templates/layout.tmpl`
- [x] Wrap label text with responsive Tailwind classes (`hidden md:inline`)
- [x] Adjust sidebar width to be responsive (`w-16 md:w-32`)
- [x] Update main content margin to match sidebar width (`ml-16 md:ml-32`)

## Files Modified
- `templates/layout.tmpl` - Updated navigation rendering and layout classes

## Summary
Successfully implemented mobile-responsive navigation that:
- Shows only icons on mobile devices (below `md` breakpoint)
- Shows icons + labels on medium screens and above (`md` breakpoint and up)
- Adjusts sidebar width from 64px on mobile to 128px on desktop
- Updates main content margin accordingly to prevent overlap

The changes maintain all existing navigation functionality while providing a clean, icon-only interface on mobile devices for better space utilization.
